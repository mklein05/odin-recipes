    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
        These homemade garlic-Parmesan croutons are the perfect crunchy topping for salads and soups, 
        and they're ridiculously easy to make. Don't let stale baguettes go to waste! 
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>½ cup olive oil</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, finely minced</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) loaf French bread baguette, cut into 1/2-inch cubes</li>
        <li>¾ cup finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, divided</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon paprika</li>        
        <li>½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>

        <li>
            Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with a silicone baking mat.
        </li>

        <li>
            Stir together olive oil and garlic in a small bowl until combined. Let sit at room temperature until 
            flavors are infused, about 3 hours. 
        </li>

        <li>
            Place bread cubes in a large bowl. Pour garlic oil through a strainer onto bread; toss until bread is 
            evenly coated with oil. Add 1/2 cup Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, Italian seasoning, paprika, black pepper, 
            salt, and cayenne pepper; toss to coat. Spread bread cubes out in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet. 
        </li>

        <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Turn croutons and bake for 15 minutes more. Push croutons together 
            with a spatula to form a compact rectangle on the baking sheet. Sprinkle remaining 1/4 cup Parmigiano-Reggiano 
            cheese over the top. Continue baking until cheese is melted and croutons are crunchy, 10 to 15 minutes more. 
        </li>

    </ol>
